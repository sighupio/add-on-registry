# Registry Add-On Release 2.0.0

This is a major release containing an update to Harbor package with breaking changes.

## Changelog

- Update Harbor from version `v2.2.2` to `v2.4.2`.

## Upgrade path

There's no supported upgrade path for this module from `v1.2.0` to `v2.0.0`, there are several breaking changes in Harbor from v2.2.2 to v2.4.2, especially in [Harbor v2.3.0 the Database schema has changed](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v2.3.0), please read carefully the release notes from upstream and plan accordingly.

The recommended approach is a lift and shift migration. Start by copying over all the images from the old instance to the new one using Harbor's native replication and then sync the users and permissions.
