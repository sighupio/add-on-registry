# Registry Module version 3.0.1

## Changelog
- The trivy configuration has been updated to download the new image with the updated vulnerability database every night. To do this we have added: [an image that is built every night](https://github.com/sighupio/trivy-adapter-photon-offline), an ad-hoc rbac and a cronjob to restart the pod. The new image is downloaded from the following [repository](https://quay.io/repository/sighup/trivy-adapter-photon-offline?tab=tags).

## Upgrade path

There's no supported upgrade path for this module from `v3.0.0` to `v3.0.1`.

The recommended approach is a lift and shift migration. Start by copying over all the images from the old instance to the new one using Harbor's native replication and then sync the users and permissions.
