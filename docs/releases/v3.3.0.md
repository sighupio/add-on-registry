# Registry Add-On Release 3.3.0

## Changelog

- Added compatibility with Kubernetes versions 1.32.x.
- :warning: Updated Harbor to version 2.9.5. This update removes depcreated components such as ChartMuseum and Notary. Please check the [Upgrade path section](#upgrade-path) to handle ChartMuseum migration to OCI. No migration path or alternative is suggested for Notary.
- :warning: Updated the Kustomization project to use modern Kustomize. This was developed using features from kustomize 5.6.0 and may not work in previous versions of Kustomize.

## Upgrade path

### Pre-upgrade
* Backup the database that Harbor is using underneath.
* If you are using an external database, make sure the version of PostgreSQL is >= 12.
* If you are hosting Helm Charts using ChartMuseum, you will need to migrate your Charts to OCI format. To do this, please follow [Harbor's official migration guide](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Migrate-helm-chart-to-oci-registry-in-Harbor).

### Upgrade
Download new module's version, then apply the `kustomize` project. No further action is required.
