# Registry Add-On Release 3.3.0

## Changelog

- Added compatibility with Kubernetes versions 1.32.x.
- :warning: Updated Harbor to version 2.9.5. This update removes depcreated components such as ChartMuseum and Notary. Please check the [Upgrade path section](#upgrade-path) to handle ChartMuseum migration to OCI. No migration path or alternative is suggested for Notary.
- :warning: Updated the Kustomization project to use modern Kustomize. This was developed using features from kustomize 5.6.0 and may not work in previous versions of Kustomize.

## Upgrade path

### Pre-upgrade
* Backup the database that Harbor is using underneath.
* If you are using an external database, make sure the version of PostgreSQL is >= 12.
* If you are hosting Helm Charts using ChartMuseum, you will need to migrate your Charts to OCI format, since ChartMuseum support (not the workloads) will be removed during this upgrade. Please follow [Harbor's official migration guide](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Migrate-helm-chart-to-oci-registry-in-Harbor).

### Upgrade
Download new module's version, then apply the `kustomize` project.

### Post-upgrade
You can delete ChartMuseum and Notary workloads.
```bash
kubectl delete all -n registry -l app=harbor,component=chartmuseum
kubectl delete all -n registry -l app=harbor,component=notary-signer
